Train and Test loop questions



* Generally need to set model in train or evaluation mode before the loop. Sometimes unnecessary but 
  included in our example for best practices. 

* why batch * batch_size + len(x): batch number starts at 0, so batch * batch_size is actually a step behind.
  adding len(x), which is len of current batche, brings us up to speed. Why not just start batch count at 1?
  we actually want to add len(x) in case final batch is smaller. This brings us up to correct count. 

* (pred.argmax(1) == y).type(torch.float).sum().item(): 
  
 1) pred.argmax(1): converts predictions to maximum prediction for each input. So we get a tensor with highest logits

 2) == y: tensors get compared entry-wise by this boolean operation. so each entry is compared to the associated 
          correct label. we get a tensor with [True, False, False, True, ...etc]
 
 3) .type(torch.float).sum(): converts the boolean labels True/False to floats 1/0 then sums the entries up. We
    get a tensor float representing number of correct guesses tensor(c)

 4) .item() converts tensor float to float number
